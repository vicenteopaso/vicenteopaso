I’m a **Web Engineering Manager**, **Frontend Architect**, and **Technical Leader** with over 25 years of experience building scalable, user-centered digital platforms. I specialize in modern **Frontend Architecture**, **Design Systems**, and **Developer Experience** (DevEx) — and I thrive at the intersection of engineering execution and strategic impact.

Currently at **Nexthink**, I lead the team behind [nexthink.com](https://nexthink.com), shaping our composable web platform to support brand, marketing, and product strategy. My role involves cross-functional leadership, architecture ownership, and continuous improvement across the entire web delivery pipeline.

Previously, at **EUROCONTROL** and **Carlsberg Group**, I architected Design Systems, modernized global B2B platforms, and led enterprise-scale Developer Experience transformations. I’m also a strong advocate for engineering culture — founding and leading Communities of Practice that connect grassroots innovation with strategic delivery.
