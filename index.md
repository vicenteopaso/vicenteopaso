## Core Focus Areas

- #### Frontend Architecture & Composable Platforms
  I design scalable, maintainable frontend systems using modern frameworks and composable architecture—whether for marketing websites like [nexthink.com](https://nexthink.com) or like Carlsberg's [Malty Design System](https://malty.carlsberggroup.com).

- #### Design Systems & UI Consistency
  From foundational initiatives like EDS (EUROCONTROL) to enterprise-grade component libraries like Malty (Carlsberg), I architect and lead Design System programs that drive accessibility, consistency, and design-to-code alignment across products and teams.

- #### Developer Experience (DevEx) & CI/CD
  I focus on automation and workflow optimization—implementing CI/CD pipelines, onboarding frameworks, and AI-assisted tooling to improve delivery velocity, quality, and developer satisfaction.

- #### Leadership & Communities of Practice (CoP)
  I foster technical alignment, mentorship, cross-functional collaboration, and distributed team leadership through CoPs that scale shared practices, governance, and innovation across global teams.

- #### Cross-Functional Collaboration
  I work closely with design, product, marketing, and compliance stakeholders to ensure architectural integrity, business impact, and long-term maintainability in every deliverable.

- #### Accessibility & Performance
  I champion inclusive, high-performance user experiences—meeting WCAG 2.1 standards while optimizing for SEO, responsiveness, and cross-browser reliability.

- #### Documentation & Knowledge Management
  I maintain architectural and governance documentation through platforms like Confluence and SharePoint—supporting compliance, traceability, and seamless onboarding across teams.
