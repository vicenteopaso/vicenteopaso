## Core Focus Areas

- #### Frontend Architecture & Composable Platforms
  I design scalable, maintainable frontend systems using modern frameworks and composable architecture—whether for marketing platforms like [nexthink.com](https://nexthink.com) or design systems like Malty.

- #### Design Systems & UI Consistency
  From foundational systems like EDS (EUROCONTROL) to scalable component libraries like Malty (Carlsberg), I build and lead initiatives that ensure accessible, consistent UI across products and teams.

- #### Developer Experience (DevEx) & CI/CD
  I implement automated pipelines, onboarding flows, and AI-enhanced tooling to streamline delivery and reduce friction—improving quality, velocity, and team morale.

- #### Leadership & Community of Practice (CoP)
  I foster knowledge sharing, mentorship, and alignment through cross-functional CoPs that drive standards, governance, and continuous improvement across teams.

- #### Cross-Functional Collaboration
  I work closely with design, product, compliance, and brand teams to ensure architectural alignment, business value, and operational readiness in every deliverable.

- #### Accessibility & Performance
  I ensure platforms meet WCAG 2.1 standards and optimize for SEO, performance, and cross-browser reliability—making digital experiences inclusive and discoverable.

- #### Documentation & Knowledge Management
  I maintain architectural documentation across systems like Confluence and SharePoint to ensure traceability, compliance, and onboarding readiness.
