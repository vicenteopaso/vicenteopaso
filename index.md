## Core Focus Areas

- #### Frontend Architecture & Composable Platforms
  I design scalable, maintainable frontend systems using modern frameworks and composable architecture—whether for marketing platforms like [nexthink.com](https://nexthink.com) or design systems like Malty.

- #### Developer Experience & CI/CD Optimization
  I improve delivery velocity and code quality by introducing automated pipelines, streamlined tooling, and secure workflows tailored for global teams.

- #### Engineering Culture & Community Building
  Through Communities of Practice, task forces, and steering groups, I help teams collaborate more effectively, share knowledge, and align on standards.

- #### Cross-Functional Product Delivery
  I work closely with product, design, and engineering to turn complex requirements into elegant, scalable digital experiences.
