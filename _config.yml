  bio: "I'm a Web Engineering Manager and Frontend Architect with over 25 years of experience helping organizations build accessible, scalable, and maintainable digital platforms across enterprise, e-commerce, and mission-critical domains.<br/><br/>My expertise lies in bridging frontend architecture, design systems, and business strategy—enabling fast delivery, consistent experiences, and empowered engineering teams. Whether designing composable web platforms, scaling design systems, or improving Developer Experience (DevEx), I focus on maintainability, clarity, and long-term alignment.<br/><br/>At <b>Nexthink</b>, I lead the Web Engineering team behind <b>nexthink.com</b>—our global digital platform. I oversee architecture and delivery of a composable stack built with <b>Next.js</b>, <b>GraphQL</b>, <b>Tailwind CSS</b>, and <b>Hygraph CMS</b>, deployed on <b>Vercel</b>. My focus is on performance, accessibility, and collaboration, managing a lean cross-functional team while strengthening developer experience through automation, guardrails, and Community-of-Practice (CoP)–driven knowledge sharing.<br/><br/>Previously, at <b>EUROCONTROL</b>, I led frontend governance and modernization for aviation-critical systems within the Network Manager Operations Centre (NMOC). I defined the vision for the <b>EUROCONTROL Design System (EDS)</b> and introduced developer experience improvements across CI/CD, documentation, and microfrontend frameworks—all while ensuring compliance with safety and regulatory standards.<br/><br/>Earlier, at <b>Carlsberg Group</b>, I architected the <b>Malty Design System</b>, a global React/TypeScript component library powering the company’s B2B and marketing platforms. I also founded Carlsberg’s first <b>Frontend Community of Practice (CoP)</b>, fostering shared tooling, code reuse, and scalable engineering culture. My work there bridged design and development, improving delivery velocity, governance, and cross-functional collaboration.<br/><br/>Before that, I co-founded <b>Greygoo</b>, where I led design and delivery of web and mobile solutions for clients such as General Motors, GO GROUND (NCAA), and public-sector institutions. I also contributed to projects across healthcare, e-commerce, and telecommunications—delivering Angular platforms, A/B testing pipelines, and network rollouts for <b>Nokia</b> across the U.S.<br/><br/>I believe in building systems and teams that scale—architectures that enable autonomy, processes that reduce friction, and cultures where knowledge flows freely."
